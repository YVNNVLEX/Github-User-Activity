# Roadmap.sh Github Activities CLI

According to my training on roadmap.sh site, I build a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project will help me to practice my Python programming skills, including working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.  

Usage of this CLI is simple:
The syntax is like: user **Github user valid name**

Example: user ln-dev7
Output:
User has no recent issue
User ln-dev7 pushed 23 commits to ln-dev7/pqoqubbw-icons
User has no recent PullRequest
started rorkai/21st

For now it's just a training app, I will improve the features to filtering and many funny feature.

Thanks for reading me, and hope I will receive many stars and advice for my codebase.
